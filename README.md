What is Worldcoin?
----------------

Worldcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Worldcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Worldcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately usable, binary version of
the Worldcoin Core software, see https://worldcoin.global.

License
-------

Worldcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.
